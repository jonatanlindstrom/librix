librix
======

An library catalog for home use. Modeled to look like I remember Dynix from my childhood.

### Goals
The goals of the project falls into three groups: practical, knowlede based and design.

Practical goals:
* Create a catalog for my home collections of books, movies, music and games.
* Create a system for lending items from my collection so I know where my stuff is.

Knowledge based goals:
* Learn about the Dewey Decimal Classification system
* Learn about the Python curses library
* Learn about MongoDB

Design goals:
* Everything was better in the past (when everything was worse). I want to relive the aestetics of old terminals but still make it functional.

Bonus goals:
* Wouldn't it be nice if I made this run on a Raspberry Pi connected to the TV?
